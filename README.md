# WeRateDogs-twitter-analysis

This report gathers and explores nearly 2,000 original tweets from the WeRateDogs twitter page. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. For this project, I gathered data from three sources:  
- A csv file of some columns of WeRateDogâ€™s twitter archive (provided by Udacity); in addition to data they pulled from Twitter, Udacity also included columns for rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) that were extracted from each tweet's text if present.   
- An image prediction table with breed predictions for each tweet according to a neural network (provided by Udacity)   
- Additional twitter data that I collected on my own by querying the Twitter API (including favorite counts and retweet counts)  
  
After gathering, assessing, and cleaning the data, I include an analysis and visualization section specifically exploring favorite counts, retweet counts, and ratings for different dog stages (i.e. pupper, doggo, puppo, or floofer) and dog breeds, as well as how these metrics changed over time.
